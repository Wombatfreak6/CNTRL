# Vibe Browser

Vibe Browser is an experimental desktop browser for intent-based autonomous browsing. It combines a Tauri v2 Rust backend with a SolidJS frontend, native child webviews, compatibility fallback rendering, and a configurable AI router for local and cloud model providers.

The project is currently an early-stage prototype. It already includes browser chrome, tab management, native webview navigation, fallback HTML rendering, AI model configuration, and intent-tier scoring. Natural-language command execution, persistent memory, background agents, and a plugin SDK are planned but not complete.

## Features

- Desktop browser shell built with Tauri v2, Rust, SolidJS, TypeScript, and Vite.
- Multi-tab browser UI with new tab, close tab, active tab switching, back, forward, reload, and URL navigation.
- Native webview engine using Tauri child webviews.
- Compatibility fallback mode for pages that do not load in the native child webview within the timeout window.
- Internal settings page at `vibe://settings`.
- AI router with three tiers:
  - Local: Ollama-compatible local models.
  - Freemium: OpenRouter free models.
  - Premium: OpenRouter or other compatible higher-capability models.
- OpenRouter key storage with masked UI display.
- Intent scoring helper that routes sample intents toward local, freemium, or premium model tiers.
- Frontend tests with Vitest and Solid Testing Library.
- Rust service tests and integration-test scaffolding.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or newer.
- npm.
- Rust stable toolchain.
- Tauri v2 system prerequisites for your OS.
- Optional: Ollama for local model routing.
- Optional: OpenRouter API key for freemium or premium model routing.

See the official Tauri prerequisites guide for OS-specific packages: https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the Tauri development app:

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

Run the frontend only:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build the frontend:

```bash
npm run build
```

Build the Tauri app:

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

## AI Configuration

Open the settings page from the browser toolbar or navigate to:

```text
vibe://settings
```

Available tiers:

- `Local`: sends prompts to an Ollama server. The default Ollama URL is `http://localhost:11434`.
- `Freemium`: uses OpenRouter free models.
- `Premium`: uses the selected paid or higher-capability model through OpenRouter-compatible routing.

OpenRouter keys are stored by the desktop backend and displayed as a masked placeholder in the UI. Do not commit real API keys, local storage files, `.env` files, or app data generated during testing.

## Testing

Run frontend tests:

```bash
npm test
```

If the repository does not yet define an npm test script, use:

```bash
npx vitest run
```

Run Rust tests:

```bash
cd src-tauri
cargo test
```

Run formatting:

```bash
npx biome format . --write
```
