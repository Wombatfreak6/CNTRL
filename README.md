# CNTRL Browser

**Intent-based autonomous browsing**

CNTRL Browser is a lightweight, AI-driven autonomous browser built with Tauri (Rust backend) and SolidJS (TypeScript frontend). It is designed to interpret natural language intents and execute them autonomously across the web.

## Architecture Overview
- **Runtime**: Tauri v2
- **Backend**: Rust (Business logic, SQLite memory, OS Keychain, AI router, OS webview fallback)
- **Frontend**: SolidJS + TypeScript (State: Solid stores, Styling: CSS custom properties)
- **AI Tiers**:
  - Tier 1 (Local): Ollama
  - Tier 2 (Freemium): Gemini Flash, Groq, Hugging Face
  - Tier 3 (Precision): OpenAI-compatible endpoints (Claude, GPT-4o, etc.)

## 7-Phase Build Plan

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Phase 1** | Project Scaffold & CI Pipeline | ✅ Complete |
| **Phase 2** | Webview Engine & Browser Chrome | ✅ Complete |
| **Phase 3** | Hybrid Brain & Model Router | ✅ Complete |
| **Phase 4** | Intent Layer & Command Bar | ✅ Complete |
| **Phase 5** | Memory Engine & Security Layer | 🔲 Not started |
| **Phase 6** | Background Agents & Macro Recorder | 🔲 Not started |
| **Phase 7** | Design System, Plugin SDK & OSS Release | 🔲 Not started |

### Phase 1 — Project Scaffold & CI Pipeline
Tauri v2 + SolidJS + TypeScript monorepo. Full CI pipeline: Clippy, rustfmt,
`cargo test`, `tsc --noEmit`, ESLint, Vitest. Global error types via `thiserror`.
Biome formatter. Strict TypeScript with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and
`exactOptionalPropertyTypes`.

### Phase 2 — Webview Engine & Browser Chrome
Native OS webview per tab. `BrowserService` managing tab lifecycle (open, close,
navigate, back, forward, reload). Tab bar with Cmd+T / Cmd+W / Cmd+Shift+T.
URL bar with HTTPS lock icon and HTTP warning indicator. Playwright-based
headless fallback for WebKit-hostile sites, rendered in a sandboxed iframe.

### Phase 3 — Hybrid Brain & Model Router
Trait-based provider system with per-provider files under `services/ai/`.
Tier 1 (Ollama), Tier 2 (Gemini, Groq, HuggingFace, OpenRouter), Tier 3
(generic OpenAI-compatible). Complexity scorer (0–10 int → tier mapping).
All API keys stored in the OS keychain — zero plaintext secrets on disk.
Settings UI with per-provider health indicators. OpenRouter free-model filter.
HuggingFace model list and inference.

### Phase 4 — Intent Layer & Command Bar
Natural language command classification into 7 intent types. Multi-step task
planner and executor. Cmd+K command bar overlay with live step feed.

### Phase 5 — Memory Engine & Security Layer *(planned)*
SQLite via `sqlx` for task history and habits. LanceDB semantic recall.
OS keychain audit log. Privacy mode blocking remote AI calls.

### Phase 6 — Background Agents & Macro Recorder *(planned)*
Tokio background job queue. `.vibe` macro file format. Cron scheduling.
OS notifications. Import/export and visual schedule picker.

### Phase 7 — Design System, Plugin SDK & OSS Release *(planned)*
Full Mecha-Industrial design token application. Light mode toggle. WASM
plugin sandbox. OSS documentation, example macros, release pipeline.

## Running the project locally

[#running-the-project-locally](#running-the-project-locally)

### Prerequisites

[#prerequisites](#prerequisites)

- **Node.js 20+** — <https://nodejs.org/>
- **Rust (stable toolchain)** — <https://rustup.rs>
- **Tauri v2 CLI** — installed via Cargo (see below)
- **OS-specific Tauri v2 system dependencies** — see the [Installing OS dependencies](#installing-os-dependencies) section below

### Installing OS dependencies

[#installing-os-dependencies](#installing-os-dependencies)

#### macOS
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

#### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev \
build-essential \
curl \
wget \
file \
libxdo-dev \
libssl-dev \
libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
librsvg2-dev
```

#### Windows

Tauri v2 needs a working C++ linker. You have two toolchain options:

- **MSVC (recommended, default on Windows):** install the [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) and select the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload. This provides `link.exe`, which the Rust compiler needs to produce the final binary.
- **GNU (alternative):** if you'd rather avoid Visual Studio, use the GNU toolchain instead:
  ```bash
  rustup toolchain install stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
  rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
  ```
  This requires MSYS2/MinGW-w64 on your `PATH`.

Also make sure [WebView2](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/) is installed (it ships by default on up-to-date Windows 11 systems).

### Install the Tauri CLI

[#install-the-tauri-cli](#install-the-tauri-cli)
```bash
cargo install tauri-cli
```

Verify:
```bash
cargo tauri --version
```

### 1. Clone the repository

[#1-clone-the-repository](#1-clone-the-repository)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Omnikon-Org/CNTRL.git
cd CNTRL
```

### 2. Install JavaScript dependencies

[#2-install-javascript-dependencies](#2-install-javascript-dependencies)

The repo ships with a `package-lock.json`, so use npm:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the app

[#3-run-the-app](#3-run-the-app)

**Full app (Tauri + SolidJS frontend, native window):**
```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

The first run will take noticeably longer, since Cargo has to compile the Rust backend from scratch.

**Frontend only (skip the Rust/Tauri build):**

If you just want to work on the SolidJS UI and don't need the native shell:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Environment tested

[#environment-tested](#environment-tested)

- **OS:** Windows 11 Home
- **Node.js:** v24.13.1
- **Rust:** 1.96.1 (stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu)

---

## Troubleshooting

[#troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

### Node.js version is too old

Ensure you're on Node.js 20 or later:
```bash
node -v
```

### Cargo command not found

Restart your terminal after installing Rust so `PATH` picks up Cargo.
```bash
cargo --version
```

### Tauri CLI not found
```bash
cargo install tauri-cli
cargo tauri --version
```

### `link.exe` not found / MSVC linker error (Windows)

This means the Visual Studio Build Tools' C++ workload isn't installed, or the install is incomplete. Reopen the Visual Studio Installer, confirm **"Desktop development with C++"** is checked, then restart your terminal. If you'd rather not install Visual Studio at all, switch to the GNU toolchain instead (see [Installing OS dependencies → Windows](#installing-os-dependencies) above).

### Windows Smart App Control (SAC) blocks the app — `os error 4551`

Windows Smart App Control blocks unsigned local binaries by default — this includes the debug binary that `npm run tauri dev` builds locally, since it isn't code-signed. If the app fails to launch with this error:

- Check whether SAC is on: **Settings → Privacy & security → Windows Security → App & browser control → Smart App Control**. If it's on, you can turn it off — note that once disabled, SAC can only be re-enabled via a clean Windows reinstall, so treat this as a one-way decision.
- Alternatively, develop inside a VM or a machine without SAC enabled, or sign the binary if you have a code-signing certificate available.

### Missing WebView dependencies

Refer to the official Tauri prerequisites documentation: <https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/>

### Additional notes

- Use the latest stable versions of Node.js and Rust where possible.
- If you hit dependency issues, delete `node_modules` and reinstall:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- If problems persist, update your Rust toolchain:
  ```bash
  rustup update
  ```

## Branching Model

CNTRL Browser uses a straightforward OSS branching strategy:

| Branch | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main` | **Stable integration branch.** All contributor PRs target here. Always in a passing CI state. |
| `phase-X-*` | Internal milestone branches used by core maintainers. Merged into `main` when a phase is complete. |
| `feat/<name>` | Feature branches opened by contributors. Branch from `main`, PR back to `main`. |
| `fix/<name>` | Bug fix or hotfix branches. Branch from `main`, PR back to `main`. |
| `docs/<name>` | Documentation-only changes. Branch from `main`, PR back to `main`. |

> **All pull requests must target `main`.** The `main` branch is protected — direct pushes are not allowed; every change goes through a reviewed PR that passes CI.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions of all kinds — bug fixes, features, tests, and documentation improvements.
